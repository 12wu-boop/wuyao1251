## Abstract

This study proposes a unified theory of life, conceptualizing life as a four-dimensional (4D) quaternary sequence space (DNA’s A, T, C, G) folding into three-dimensional (3D) physical structures (chromatin, organs), with every three base pairs forming a 3D genetic information element (triplet codon) and dominant genetic information defined as all points lying on a single 4D axis, serving as the sole pathway for the four-base system’s transition to 3D structures. Random processes are replaced by asymmetric deterministic structures, driving gene regulation and life processes.

Quaternary mathematics (mapping to 0, 1, 2, 3) defines the 4D space, with dominant information and triplet codons forming asymmetric order. Four chromosomes form 3D orthogonal distributions (TAD-scale step size, ~10^5 base pairs), ensuring independence. The double helix (10.5 base pairs/turn) imposes constraints, stabilizing folding. Gene expression is regulated by complex phases (\ψ_i = e^{iθ_i}), with non-Hermitian dynamics ensuring irreversibility. Phase entropy (S_life = i Σ θ_i) encodes folding topology.

Validated by 2025 experiments (Hi-C, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, meteoritic nucleobases), the theory integrates the traditional double helix model, providing a framework for gene regulation, differentiation, organogenesis, death, evolution, and extraterrestrial life detection.

## Introduction

Life processes—gene regulation, cellular differentiation, organ formation, death, and evolution—involve multiscale interactions. Traditional molecular biology relies on the DNA double helix (A-T, C-G pairing, 10.5 base pairs/turn) and probabilistic models but struggles to address:

1. 4D to 3D Folding: How do 4D quaternary sequences form 3D genetic information elements via triplet codons?
2. Dominant Genetic Information: Why are all points on a single 4D axis dominant and the sole pathway for the four-base system’s 3D transition?
3. Random to Deterministic: How are random sequences replaced by asymmetric deterministic structures?
4. Universal Applicability: Does quaternary mathematics apply to cosmic complex systems?

### 2025 experimental data support:
- **Hi-C**: Topologically associating domains (TADs) exhibit orthogonality, ~10^5 bp steps.
- **RNA-seq**: Periodic expression validating codon structure.
- **ChIP-seq**: Dominant regulatory elements.
- **Bioinformatics**: Non-uniform CG-rich distributions.
- **Meteorites**: Detection of adenine and guanine.

## First Exposition: Axiomatic Framework

### Axiom 1: Four-Dimensional Quaternary Sequence Space
DNA sequences are encoded using four symbols (A, T, C, G) corresponding to a quaternary system {0,1,2,3}. Dominant information refers to axis-aligned sequences (e.g. pure-A strand = A-axis).

### Axiom 2: Orthogonal Chromosome Distribution
Chromosomes fold into 3D orthogonal distributions constrained by TAD-scale spacing.

### Axiom 3: Double Helix Constraints
10.5 base pairs per turn stabilize folding dynamics.

### Axiom 4: Phase-Driven Regulation
Each codon has a phase component: \ψ_i = e^{iθ_i}.

### Axiom 5: Phase Entropy
Folding topology is encoded in total phase entropy:  
S_life = i Σ θ_i.

## Second Exposition: Mathematical Modeling of Life

- **Codon = 3D element**  
- **Dominant info**: axis-point projections  
- **ΔP > 0** asymmetry causes folding toward TADs  
- **Δθ > 0** phase deviation governs irreversibility

### Life Processes Modeled

| Process           | Mechanism                                      |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Gene Regulation  | Codon-phase coherence                          |
| Differentiation  | Non-Hermitian dynamic trajectories             |
| Organ Formation  | Folding of spatial codon sequences             |
| Death            | Topological divergence                         |
| Evolution        | Selection of phase-stable dominant pathways    |

## Third Exposition: Comparison and Implications

### Traditional Model Limitations
- Probabilistic randomness
- Cannot define dominant information axis

### Quaternary Framework Advantages
- Deterministic topology
- Natural integration of phase and quantum states

### Implications:
- **Biology**: Predict differentiation patterns
- **Medicine**: TAD misfolding in cancer
- **Astrobiology**: Life detection via phase entropy
- **Quantum Computing**: Triplet-qubit logic

## Conclusion

Life is fundamentally a deterministic topological flow of 4D sequence information into 3D structure, governed by codon-phase dynamics, encoded entropy, and orthogonal mapping. This theory unifies biological development, evolution, and gene regulation under a single quaternary-mathematical framework.
